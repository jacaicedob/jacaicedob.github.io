I started creating Game Boy games in 2020 using [GBStudio] [gb-studio]. It is easy to use and I made my first game in about 2 weeks. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning game development, especially if they have little or no coding experience. 

Back then, GBStudio only supported top-down games and after getting hooked on game development, I wanted to make different types of games and have more control. I found [GBDK] [gbdk], a development kit using C, which is used by GBStudio to compile games into ROMs.

So far, I have released 3 games on itch.io under my personal game account [Kicdo Games] [kicdogames]: 
* Dunkin's Adventure (GBStudio) 
* GB Snake (GBDK) 
* Friend Switch (entry for GBShowdown2023 Jam - GBStudio)

I am currently using GBDK to develop another game with a friend called Scroll Space and we will be realeasing it soon on our new collaboration [CaiLan Games] [cailangames].
